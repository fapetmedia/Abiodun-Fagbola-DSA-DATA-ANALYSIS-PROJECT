# Abiodun-Fagbola-DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
This project demonstrates a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a fictional retail company, KMS, using structured datasets to uncover key business insights and performance metrics.
## Project Overview
The SQL script includes data import, transformation, and analysis using T-SQL. A consolidated view named KMSORDER was created by joining sales records with order status to provide a full picture of transactions, returns, customer behavior, and shipping performance.
## Key Features
- Data cleansing using COALESCE to handle nulls
- View creation for efficient querying (CREATE VIEW)
- Aggregation and grouping to analyze:
  - Top-performing product categories
  - Best and worst sales regions
  - Most and least valuable customers
  - Shipping cost efficiency by delivery mode
  - Return rates by segment
